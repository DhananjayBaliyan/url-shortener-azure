Shortly: A Cloud-Native URL Shortener on Kubernetes

![Shortly Application Screenshot](shortly_main.jpg)

üöÄ Project Overview
Shortly is a fully functional URL shortening microservice application, built from the ground up and deployed on Microsoft Azure. This project demonstrates a comprehensive, hands-on understanding of modern cloud engineering and DevOps principles, including containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD automation, and resilient cloud networking.

The application is composed of three core, decoupled services:

Frontend Service: A Python Flask and JavaScript single-page application (SPA) featuring GSAP animations that provides the user interface for creating and viewing shortened links.

Backend API Service: A Python Flask API that handles the core logic for generating unique short codes, storing URL mappings in a database, and retrieving them for redirection.

Database Service: A Redis instance for high-performance, in-memory storage of URL mappings, ensuring fast lookups and redirects.

All services are deployed as versioned containers within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The entire deployment process is automated through a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, ensuring consistent and reliable releases.

üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
This project utilizes a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The infrastructure is fully defined through declarative YAML manifests and automated with a CI/CD pipeline.

üåü Key Features & Skills Demonstrated
End-to-End CI/CD Automation: Implemented a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that automatically builds, versions, and deploys the entire application to Kubernetes on every push to the main branch.

Microservice Architecture: Successfully designed and deployed a decoupled application, allowing for independent scaling and development of the frontend and backend.

Containerization & Versioning: Wrote custom Dockerfiles for each service and used commit SHAs as unique image tags, demonstrating best practices for building and versioning container images.

Kubernetes Deployment & Management: Deployed and managed all services on AKS using declarative YAML manifest files, showcasing proficiency in Deployments, Services, and Ingress.

Advanced Networking with Ingress: Implemented an industry-standard NGINX Ingress controller to manage all external traffic, intelligently routing requests to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path.

Cloud Infrastructure Provisioning: All necessary Azure resources, including the AKS cluster and ACR, were provisioned and configured from scratch using the Azure CLI.

Real-World Problem Solving: Diagnosed and resolved a wide range of complex, real-world issues, including:

Azure subscription limitations (VM sizes, availability zones, addon restrictions).

Container image pull permissions (ImagePullBackOff).

Complex Ingress routing bugs (404 errors, path rewriting, static file serving).

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors between services.
